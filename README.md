![silly cat without ears with the caption "NO!!!!! his eirs fell off!!!"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jan0660/kittygifs/main/docs/img/no_ears.jpg)

I am very much not a designer. I wanted to have a kitty as the logo.
I did not want it to be just the text "GIF" or something like that.
And so I made that. Best of my efforts. I think it looks kinda silly. Silly kitty!!!
